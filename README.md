# port-stock-management
The system is designed to emulate a port. Boats come to port with objects of stock, sort the stock to their designated delivery address and ouput the stock to the correct address. It also has a list of staff which can be sorted and filtered to find who your reporting manager is for any issues. I used object oriented design patterns in my implementation of this project as part of a module.
